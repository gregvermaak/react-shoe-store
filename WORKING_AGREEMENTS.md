# Working Agreements

1. Plan things out and have good time management/covering scope
   - Regular checkpoints to ensure everyone is happy with progress and planning, that there is equal participation and that any issues are managed as soon as possible
   - Make sure that you turn up to the meetings on time and ready to learn, so that youre not holding up the group.
2. Communication
   - Ensure that the rest of the group knows how you're getting along, so that no-one is left behind.
   - communication styles and experiences may differ
  - need to ensure everyone has equal say, is included in decision-making, planning and reviews/votes
   - be courteous and assume good intentions
   - we do what we say we will do
   - we act with purpose to achieve results relevant to the design brief and client requirements
3. Give constructive feedback
   - listen to each others ideas in turn, give feedback constructively and respectfully and receive feedback graciously
4. Equal contribution
   - All team members are equal, and have equal contribution to decisions
   - strong emphasis on collaboration and partnership
   - inclusive and nurture a team spirit
5. Treating everyone like a human being
    - Just be nice. Everyone has their own lives, and may be dealing with things that you cannot see from just an online chat, so being mean or negative for no reason just hurts team morale and is unnecessary.
    - build trust and trust each other
    - protection of each others ideas and perspectives
  
These agreements are based on the principals of the Treaty of Waitangi - they are designed to give every team member autonomy and positive people to partner with, while making sure that there are clear guidelines to be adhered to, so that no-one is malicious, doesnt participate, or infringes on anyone elses personal safety.
